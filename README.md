# JavaScript Exercise: Blackjack
I first began creating a Blackjack game the same week that I started learning JavaScript. It immediately came to mind as a good beginner project for several reasons. The game shares a similar logic structure to JavaScript as well as managing numerous values and conditions. It has given me good practice in creating functions and nesting them. It has also allowed me to explore objects in JavaScript and see how they work as parameters. The game currently only holds the most basic game logic, but I see this as another advantage to this project. I can continue to evolve it, adding and restructuring in order to allow for more in-depth game play as I continue to hone my programming skills. It also presents a design challenge. Currently, it's not responsive and the card sizes aren't properly proportionate. Eventually, I intend to add animations as well as a sleek mobile design.
